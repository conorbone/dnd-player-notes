### Meta-Data

MkDocs includes support for both YAML and MultiMarkdown style meta-data (often called front-matter). Meta-data consists of a series of keywords and values defined at the beginning of a Markdown document, which are stripped from the document prior to it being processing by Python-Markdown. The key/value pairs are passed by MkDocs to the page template. Therefore, if a theme includes support, the values of any keys can be displayed on the page or used to control the page rendering. See your theme's documentation for information about which keys may be supported, if any.

In addition to displaying information in a template, MkDocs includes support for a few predefined meta-data keys which can alter the behavior of MkDocs for that specific page. The following keys are supported:

- **`template`**
    
    The template to use with the current page.
    
    By default, MkDocs uses the `main.html` template of a theme to render Markdown pages. You can use the `template` meta-data key to define a different template file for that specific page. The template file must be available on the path(s) defined in the theme's environment.
    
- **`title`**
    
    The "title" to use for the document.
    
    MkDocs will attempt to determine the title of a document in the following ways, in order:
    
    1. A title defined in the [nav](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#nav) configuration setting for a document.
        
    2. A title defined in the `title` meta-data key of a document.
        
    3. A level 1 Markdown header on the first line of the document body.  
        ([Setext-style](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#header) headers are supported _only since MkDocs 1.5_.)
        
    4. The filename of a document.
        
    
    Upon finding a title for a page, MkDoc does not continue checking any additional sources in the above list.
    

#### YAML Style Meta-Data

YAML style meta-data consists of [YAML](https://yaml.org) key/value pairs wrapped in YAML style delimiters to mark the start and/or end of the meta-data. The first line of a document must be `---`. The meta-data ends at the first line containing an end deliminator (either `---` or `...`). The content between the delimiters is parsed as [YAML](https://yaml.org).

```text
---
title: My Document
summary: A brief description of my document.
authors:
    - Waylan Limberg
    - Tom Christie
date: 2018-07-10
some_url: https://example.com
---
This is the first paragraph of the document.
```

YAML is able to detect data types. Therefore, in the above example, the values of `title`, `summary` and `some_url` are strings, the value of `authors` is a list of strings and the value of `date` is a `datetime.date` object. Note that the YAML keys are case sensitive and MkDocs expects keys to be all lowercase. The top level of the YAML must be a collection of key/value pairs, which results in a Python `dict` being returned. If any other type is returned or the YAML parser encounters an error, then MkDocs does not recognize the section as meta-data, the page's `meta` attribute will be empty, and the section is not removed from the document.

#### MultiMarkdown Style Meta-Data

MultiMarkdown style meta-data uses a format first introduced by the [MultiMarkdown](https://fletcherpenney.net/MultiMarkdown_Syntax_Guide#metadata) project. The data consists of a series of keywords and values defined at the beginning of a Markdown document, like this:

```text
Title:   My Document
Summary: A brief description of my document.
Authors: Waylan Limberg
         Tom Christie
Date:    January 23, 2018
blank-value:
some_url: https://example.com

This is the first paragraph of the document.
```

The keywords are case-insensitive and may consist of letters, numbers, underscores and dashes and must end with a colon. The values consist of anything following the colon on the line and may even be blank.

If a line is indented by 4 or more spaces, that line is assumed to be an additional line of the value for the previous keyword. A keyword may have as many lines as desired. All lines are joined into a single string.

The first blank line ends all meta-data for the document. Therefore, the first line of a document must not be blank.

Note

MkDocs does not support YAML style delimiters (`---` or `...`) for MultiMarkdown style meta-data. In fact, MkDocs relies on the the presence or absence of the delimiters to determine whether YAML style meta-data or MultiMarkdown style meta-data is being used. If the delimiters are detected, but the content between the delimiters is not valid YAML meta-data, MkDocs does not attempt to parse the content as MultiMarkdown style meta-data.
